## Need help?

There are 2 video tutorials available on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8dhWlMqCoCxYD1M2TnUHwA) which can help you. The [Abendigo Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jd0fDMDjxw) video is a good place to start.

Take a look and follow our [brand new user guide](https://github.com/Jire/Abendigo/blob/master/USER_GUIDE.md)!

You can [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/bMPe8w3) where you can pretty immediate help from other users, but beware the knuckleheads. You can sometimes find me in a voice channel, where we can talk over your problem if you present it in an approachable way - but again, be aware that I'm a knucklehead and sometimes might be busy, too.

Finally for major issues, you can [submit an issue](https://github.com/Jire/Abendigo/issues/new) on our repository. Please note that I'm more likely to respond based upon how much effort you put into presenting your problem, i.e., the longer the better is a good rule of thumb. Remember to list all the steps you've tried to resolve the issue, and any guesses as to why the issue occurs are a big plus as well.

## Official controller client

You can find our official controller client here: https://github.com/Jire/Abendigo-Controller

The controller protocol is very simple, you can also easily make your own controller in your language of choice.
